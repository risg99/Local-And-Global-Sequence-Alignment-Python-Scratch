# Local-And-Global-Sequence-Alignment-Python-Scratch
This repository contains implementation of local sequence alignment and global sequence alignment in Python from scratch. The files in this repository contain LocalAlignment and GlobalAlignment python files with comments for easy understanding.

Sequence alignment technique is prevalent in bioinformatics for arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or proteins. This alignment brings out the functional, structural, or any evolutionary relationship between the sequences. It involves arranging two or more sequences by searching for a series of individual characters or patterns that are the same in the sequences.
